### Prediction of TED-Talk Views

Arnaud, Ram, Sophie, Duncan, &amp; Jules 

TED talks are video recordings of influential talks given at and hosted by TED Conferences LLC. TED was founded in 1984, and has since built a reputation for spreading inspiring powerful ideas in fields ranging from tech to science to education, with its videos having garnered over 1 billion views to date. 

The goal of this project is to use various features associated with TED talks -- such as the topic, speaker, conference year, and length of the talk -- to predict the number of views a TED talk may receive.
